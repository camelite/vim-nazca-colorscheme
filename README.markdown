#Nazca
###A Vim Colorscheme with enhanced javascript highlighting
This is Nazca and it is based in ir_black and Sunburst for Textmate. 
For more info about [Nazca, Peru] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazca) 

I've tweaked this colorscheme for Web Development, so it works nice with Javascript, X(HTML)5, Ruby and CSS 
Any other filetypes should look nice as well. 
I should note I used a customized version of Yi Zhao's [Javascript syntax file](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3425)

For uniform appearance, I've tested it in graphical Vim full color (gvim and macvim) and also 256 color iTerm2.app in Mac OSX and the gnome terminal in Linux.

Please feel free to modified to suit your own needs.
